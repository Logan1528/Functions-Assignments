Q2. Create a JavaScript function called generateGreeting that takes a name as an argument and returns a
personalized greeting message. Use this function to greet three different people.

function generateGreeting (name){
    console.log(`Hi ${name}, Have a nice day`);
}

generateGreeting("vasu");
generateGreeting("Priya");
generateGreeting("Jhon");

Output:

Hi vasu, Have a nice day
Hi Priya, Have a nice day
Hi Jhon, Have a nice day
